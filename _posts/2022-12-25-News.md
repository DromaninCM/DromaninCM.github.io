A master (M2) thesis (6 months) supervised by me is available in the "Computational Electronic" group at "Centre for Nanosciences and Nanotechnologies" (Paris, France). The thesis is linked to sustainable and renewable energy and it can go towards two possible subjects, depending on the student's interests:

- "Effects of low dimensionality and topological states on excitons"
- "Effects of low dimensionality and topological states on thermoelectricity"

The aim of the students will be to use state-of-the art ab-initio techniques to investigate the effect of low-dimensionality and/or topological phase transition on the electronic structure, transport and/or optical properties.

Methods in use: Density Functional Theory (DFT), GW corrections, anharmonicity (SSCHA), tight-binding methods

Applicant skills: A strong background in solid state physics as well as knowledge of electronic structure theory and computataional languages (Fortran, C++, Python, Julia). Previous experience of DFT codes (e.g. Quantum ESPRESSO) would be advantageous.

Possibility for a PhD: Yes, subject to funding availability

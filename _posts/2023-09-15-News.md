Are you a master student in Physics, Theoretical Chemistry of Material Science? ðŸ”¬

Are you looking for an interdisciplinary master thesis at the edge of condensed matter physics and renewable energy in the Paris area?

Have a look at these proposals: ðŸ‘‰ Ab-initio investigation of topological insulators for thermoelectric applications ðŸ‘‰ Ab-initio investigation of optical properties in topologically insulating polymers

You will have the opportunity to perform your thesis in one of the top research facilities (C2N - Centre de Nanosciences et de Nanotechnologies) and universities (UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay) in France!

Feel free to reach me out for more information!

Methods in use: Density Functional Theory (DFT), GW corrections, anharmonicity (SSCHA), tight-binding methods

Applicant skills: A strong background in solid state physics as well as knowledge of electronic structure theory and computataional languages (Fortran, C++, Python, Julia). Previous experience of DFT codes (e.g. Quantum ESPRESSO) would be advantageous.

Possibility for a PhD: Yes, with funds

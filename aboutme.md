### Work Experience

* **11/2020 -- Today**: _Post-doctoral fellow_  
Sorbonne Universitées, CNRS - INSP (Paris, France) in Dr. Alex Chin's group  
Subject: _Optical properties of topologically insulating pi-conjugated polymers_  
Summary of research activity: The objective of this research project is to study the optical properties of polymers and molecules, in particular excitons, and how they are affected by quantum nuclear and thermal fluctuations (at zero temperature and at finite temperature) using ab-initio techniques. The electronic structure is studied using density functional theory and the optical properties and excitons are explored with N-body corrections (GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter equation). Finally, quantum anharmonic fluctuations (phonon-phonon interaction) are taken into account using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation.

Co-Tutor: Prof. Matteo Calandra (Università di Trento, Italy)  
Thesis: [_Electron-phonon interactions in low-dimensional carbon systems: superconductivity and charge density waves_](https://iris.polito.it/handle/11583/2872341?mode=full.15420)  
Summary of research activity: In this thesis work, I investigated the effects of electron-phonon interactions in low-dimensional carbon allotropes from first principles. In particular, I focused on the emergence of superconducting phase transitions when doping systems by field effect and the appearance of charge density waves (CDW) due to reduced dimensionality. To do this, I exploited density functional theory (DFT) and its linear response extension (DFPT), also taking into account electronic correlations via hybrid exchange-correlation functionals and the approximation GW. Moreover, when studying the CDW transition, I also took into account the anharmonic phonon-phonon interaction via the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA).

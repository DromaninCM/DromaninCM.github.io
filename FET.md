Thanks to the field effect electrostatic (electrochemical) doping it is possible to achieve both positive and negative shifts in the transition, as well as to tune other strongly correlated phenomena (such as Mott-Hubbard transition, charge-density-waves, insulator-to-metal transition and ferromagnetism).

I studied, via density functional theory calculations and its linear response extension, how field effect doping affects the transport properties of MoS2 nanolayers, the anomalous screening of the electric field at the interface of a conventional superconductor (NbN) and the failure of the Thomas-Fermi theory of high electric field screening. I have also studied the possibility of inducing a superconductive phase transition in diamond thin films via electrochemical gating.

## Field-effect induced superconductivity in hydrogenated diamond thin films:

I have investigated the possible occurrence of field-effect induced superconductivity in the hydrogenated (111) diamond surface by first-principles calculations. I have found that at a doping level as large as n = 6 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−2</sup>, where the Fermi level crosses three valence bands, the electron-phonon interaction is λ = 0.81 and superconductivity emerges with T<sub>C</sub> ≈ 29 − 36 K. Superconductivity is mostly supported by in-plane diamond phonon vibrations and to a lesser extent by some out-of-plane vibrations. The relevant electron-phonon scattering processes involve both intra and interband scattering so that superconductivity is multiband in nature.

Starting from the band-resolved electron-phonon spectral functions α<sup>2</sup>F<sub>jj′</sub> (ω) computed ab initio, I have iteratively solved the self-consistent isotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations, in both the single-band and the multi-band formulations, in the approximation of a constant density of states at the Fermi level. In the single-band formulation, I have found T<sub>C</sub> ≈ 40 K, which is enhanced between 4% and 8% when the multi-band nature of the system is taken into account.

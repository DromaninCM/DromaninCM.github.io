Thanks to the field effect electrostatic doping it is possible to achieve both positive and negative shifts in the transition, as well as to tune other strongly correlated phenomena (such as Mott-Hubbard transition, charge-density-waves, insulator-to-metal transition and ferromagnetism).

I studied, via density functional theory calculations and its linear response extension, how field effect doping affects the transport properties of MoS2 nanolayers, the anomalous screening of the electric field at the interface of a conventional superconductor (NbN) and the failure of the Thomas-Fermi theory of high electric field screening. I have also studied the possibility of inducing a superconductive phase transition in diamond thin films via electrochemical gating.

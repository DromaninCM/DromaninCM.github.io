My research activity is located at the crossroads between <b>condensed matter physics</b>, <b>theoretical chemistry</b> and <b>materials science</b>. 
More precisely, I use electronic structure theory (density functional theory and N-body GW corrections) applied to carbon-based and low-dimensional materials. 
During my PhD I have focused on the study of electron-phonon interaction, with emphasis on conventional superconductivity and charge density waves. 
Lately, I have focused on optical properties (excitons) of polymers and molecules and their interaction with phonons (exciton-phonon interaction). 
I also work closely with experimental groups, for which I provide theoretical support for transport measurements in two-dimensional systems and vibrational properties of materials (such as Raman spectroscopy).
